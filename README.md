a project where I collect all of my quantitative finance & algorithmic trading knowledge together and work,
collect the codes up, reviewing the projects, managing it, upgrading, saving and leaving milestones in the way for others,
friends, and for future me.

First, I wanted to step on volatility & momentum seeking and maybe training a model about it.

## Volatility & Momentum Based Model

### Overview of the model:
Objective:
The primary objective of this model is to identify periods of increased volatility and significant momentum in financial markets, particularly when they indicate the initiation of a price trend. This model focuses on utilizing key indicators, specifically volume, rate of change (ROC), and on-balance volume (OBV), to make informed assessments of market conditions.

Key Components:

Volume: Volume, representing the number of assets traded during a specific time period, serves as a crucial input for assessing market activity. Unusual spikes in volume often precede significant price movements, and this metric will play a central role in the model's analysis.

Rate of Change (ROC): ROC calculates the percentage change in asset prices over a specified time frame. It helps in identifying rapid price changes, which can be indicative of momentum shifts in the market.

On-Balance Volume (OBV): OBV is a volume-based indicator that tracks the cumulative volume flow in and out of an asset. It is utilized to gauge the strength of trends and identify potential trend reversals.

Machine Learning Approach:
The model employs machine learning techniques to automate the process of seeking substantial market moves. Although specific details regarding LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models are not provided due to limited familiarity, the overarching goal is to educate a machine learning model. This model aims to detect significant market movements that may lead to potential trading opportunities.

Model Output:
The output of the model will be alerts or signals generated when it detects conditions suggestive of noteworthy volatility or momentum in the market. These alerts will serve as indications for further investigation or potential trading actions.

Implementation Considerations:
Given the potential complexity of LSTM and GARCH models, the initial implementation may involve simpler machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques. The model will continuously evolve as the user's knowledge and expertise in these advanced models grow.
